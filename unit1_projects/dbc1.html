		<p>This is a page dedicated to knowing me a little better. <br> Don't beleive everything you read on this page, in the interest of time and making myself seem cooler than I am, I may have made some things up.</p>
		<h2>Some random things about me:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>99% of the time I fall asleep with Friends playing in the background</li>
				<li>I used to <b>hate</b> onions but now eat them raw and put them on anything</li>
				<li>One of my earliest childhood memories is crying to my Dad on the way to preschool because I couldn't read yet. I remember he laughed at me.</li>					
			</ul>
		<div><p>I suppose I should get to talking about the serious stuff. What I do, why I'm here, yada yada yada. Well, I spent the last seven years of my life in advertising sales. I worked at the Goog (Google) then at the Book (Facebook). I loved it at both places, but about a year ago I decided I was ready for a new challenge. And so here I am, hoping and praying that I can maybe one day make it on the tech side of the house. <br> Ok, enough real talk...</p></div>
		<h2>An embarassing story:</h2>
		<h3>It's actually really sad so I think I'll whisper</h3>
		<h4>When I was younger I wanted to be on a certain reality tv show</h4>
		<h5>Want to know which one? Can't believe I'm admitting this...</h5>
		<h6><i>"Flavor of Love"</i>. Proceed with your judgment...</h6>
		<h2>Me across the web:</h2>
