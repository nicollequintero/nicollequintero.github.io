				I had a fun first go at learning Javascript for the first time this week. Given my very limited coding experience I don't have enough context for fully understanding the debate on whether Javascript is really the best thing since sliced bread, or not. As I see it, there are a few things worth noting:
				<br><br>
				It's Big. Javascript is everywhere - everyone's talking about it, everyone's asking about it, everyone's writing in it even if relunctantly. It's compatibility if not also it's ease of use got the balling rolling and it grew from there.
				<br><br>
				Interactivity is key. Again I don't fully understand what else I could use to so easily design a game or make my html come to life, but the ability to have the user truly participate in your page's experience is awesome. 
				<br><br>
				There is SO much Javascript. Not only does it come with its own robust libraries, but people have built on top of it. What that means is if you want to do something to your page, it's very very likely that someone else thought of it and if it's a cool enough idea, wrote code that you can use on your own page. 
				<br><br>
				Security at risk. I don't fully understand this, but it seems there are inherent security issues. Because Javascript executes locally on your computer (meaning that your computer, not a web server does the work), that opens the ability for unkind people to do unkind things to your computer.
