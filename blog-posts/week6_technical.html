				I chose to write about the difference between Object Oriented programming and functional programming precisely because I don't fully understand it. (So apologies to anyone who is here to learn...)
				<br><br>
				As the argument goes, OOP is all about flexibility. The order of the lines of codes don't matter, methods can be transformed and used for objectives other than ones originally sought, and in general your program can take on a life as it's own as objects interact with each other. Functional programming on the other hand seems to be all about predictability. There's a set order and purpose for everything - functions are to execute as-is and won't stray from the intended result.
				<br><br>
				Although we're talking about programming either way, listening to people debate the merits of each sound a lot to me like a debate over whether the arts or sciences is "better". Functional programming, like math, is preferred by those who like there being one right answer and way. OOP enthusiasts revel in the creativity and endless possibilities of the art of coding.
				<br><br>
				In my reading I hear it repeated often that OOP models the real world because in the real world we talk about objects - people, animals, electronic gadgets, etc. I get that part of it, but it's hard at this point to really wrap my head around this concept since the coding I've done so far is limited and hardly mirrors the richness of the real world at all. Simple grocery lists. A board game. A bakery menu. All very functional, rather than interactive and evolving in nature. I look forward to gaining more coding experience and being taken aback by all the things my program can do that I didn't think imagine from the start. It all sounds very artificial-intelligence-y to me which is very cool, but also very scary.
				<br><br>
				In the end, my baby coder-brain can't comprehend complex theories yet. So instead I'm taking the very functional approach of making guidelines on how to think of the bigger picture. For example, in "Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby", Sandi Metz gives great pointers on how to take advantage of the richness of OOD. A few of my early take-aways:</p>
				<ul>
				<li> Make sure each class and method only has one single responsibility. This makes it so that your code is easier to update later, but more importantly it allows you to re-use that method elsewhere in your program that you might not have anticipated earlier.</li>
				<li> Be class or object agnostic where possible. Again this suits you for keeping your code free of repetition and is also where the idea of "I didn't even think of that" comes from. For example, a method that adds two numbers together will only ever do that, integers creating more integers. But if you take a step back and create a method that adds two of anything together, you can now do so much more with strings, arrays, hashes, etc.</li>
				<li> Have methods accept a hash as a parameter so that you aren't bound by sending information in a specific order or number. It's all about preparing for flexibility!</li>
				</ul>
				<br>

				I wasn't able to find a resource that gave me that "aha" moment regarding the difference between OOP and functional programming. Which means I may have to accept my own challenge of creating one once I master the subject. In the meantime, I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEfSFrk_KEI">this short video</a> to be a good start.
