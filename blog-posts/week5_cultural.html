				I've absolutely come to love pairing! I will be completely honest and admit that I expect to semi-hate the process. On the one hand I thought I'd be exposed as a fraud with nothing to contribute to anyone else's work. And on the other hand I had flashbacks to middle school projects where I'd inevitably do all the work and only get half the praise. I'm so very glad to report that neither of these scenarios fit the bill. Pairing with different folks each week has been an affirmation that DBC does a wonderful job of finding people who are smart, intellectually curious and incredibly kind and understanding. That gives me a little hope that maybe they didn't make a mistake on me either!
				<br><br>
				They say misery loves company. Well, I'm not miserable but sometimes I do struggle. And struggle loves company. The people I've paired with have either blown me away when I look at their sites and posts or blown me away with their code. And when I sign on to Google Hangout and hear the voice behind all the genius work admit there's a little bit of struggle on their end too, I breathe a deep sigh of relief. I am not alone. 
				<br><br>
				I've learned multiple things from every person I've met. Even when I think there's something I have down pact or don't need too much help with, seeing things from a different perspective reminds me that there's always room to grow. When I refactor I find myself drawing on these experiences and push myself to think more creatively. 
				<br><br>
				Feedback is paramount to the pairing and growing process. I get a little knot in the pit of my stomach when I begin to read my own reviews - “hope my big mouth didn't say something horribly offensive!”, “did they secretly hate me and found the hour to be a waste of time??”. But so far, the feedback I've received has been yet another sign that I need to take a chill pill and not worry so much. In fact, one person even told me to stop calling my ideas “stupid” - thank you, I really needed that! Even the process of writing feedback has been helpful for my own growth. When I have some areas of improvement to share, I first reflect on what that means about me - either why I didn't share that during the sessions, or does the same criticism apply to me just as much or more than my pair?
				<br><br>
				In general the process of pairing and giving feedback, while at times slightly tedious from a scheduling or creative writing standpoint, has been hugely helpful for my learning. I wish I did it more often and will strive to in the coming weeks of Phase 0, but knowing full well that I'll get my lion's share come August 25th. I can't wait!
