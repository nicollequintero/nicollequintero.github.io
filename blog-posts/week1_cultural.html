			<p class = "entrydate"> June 29, 2014</p>
			<p class = "entrytext">
				What a first week! I went through a rollercoaster of emotions and what might be the beginning of a spiritual awakening. I can only describe watching Shereef's video to end the week as PERFECT. I feel validated, forgived, and motivated by hearing him say this experience is absolutely supposed to kick your ass. 
				<br><br>
				At the beginning of the week I felt incredibly frustrated by myself, my abilities and the experience as well if I'm being honest. It wasn't after several late nights, three dial-ins to office hours and begging for assurance from everyone close to me that it all began to click. And no, not the coding (though I nearly cried of happiness when I learned to properly sync my repos), but the EXPERIENCE. There's method in the madness - I won't pretend to fully understand it, but I trust in it now. I was excited before joining, nervous once I got started, and now am the perfect balance of both. Very excited to learn about myself through this journey, but fearful and nervous enough that I'll put in the work to make it worthwhile.
				<br><br>
				At my last job I created a one-week intensive that I called "Sales Bootcamp." It was an onboarding program for all new hires that I developed by complete accident. In my leading over ten cycles of Sales Bootcamp, I learned a lot about learning. How tough it can be for adults, for Type As, for absolute beginners. And how tough we can be on ourselves especially. I spent a lot of time coaching and listening to new hires during and after their Bootcamp experiences and cheering them on. All that is to say, I've said similar words quite often, but never did they ring so true as they did out of Shereef's mouth and into my ears this Sunday night.
				<br><br>
				Right now I'll admit that I'm scared shitless. I feel like Ed Norton's character in "Fight Club" (wait what, I did all that beating to myself??). I'm uncertain of the future. But most of all, I'm pumped.
