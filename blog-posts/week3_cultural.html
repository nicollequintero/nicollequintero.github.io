			<p class = "entrydate"> July 13, 2014</p>

			<p class = "entrytext">
				Phase 0 has been amazing so far. By that I mean amazingly awesome and amazingly scary. I'm learning a lot myself, how I learn, how I approach things. Some discoveries:
				<br><br>
				* I let myself get worked up a lot. Solution: breathe more, trust in the process
				<br><br>* I like the idea of planning and organization but feel time crunched and don't do enough of it. Solution: do it anyway
				<br><br>* In the moment I have thoughts and feelings and questions but don't write them down. Solution: force myself to complete reflections after each challenge rather than all at once on late Sunday nights 
				<br><br>* I go down rabbit holes and am unsure when to stop. Solution: if it's fun, keep going, find that carrot. If overwhelmed, move on quickly and come back later or ask for help
				<br><br>* I will always be a procrastinator. Solution: accept this. Enjoy the early week without feeling guilty, hunker down on nights weekends and get it done
				
				<br><br>
				I'm a concrete sequential thinker, which means I do well with exact instructions, order, predictability and specific feedback. Asking for those things in this environment (and many others) seems laughable. Which is why I struggled, and continue to, although significantly less so at this checkpoint. I'm coming to terms with the beauty in the chaos. I'm learning to apply boundaries, assess myself, and lay out my own plans.
				<br><br>
				I've fully embraced the growth mindset in terms of believing that this old dog can learn new tricks. Now it's a matter of learning new tricks to learn! As I move forward with this adventure I want to focus on: being a better (read: less flustered) communicator in times of uncertainty, turning nervous energy into productivity, and taking a step back to examine the larger picture.
