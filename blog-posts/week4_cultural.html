				The lack of women in tech is an issue very near and dear to my heart. It doesn't take much research to figure out there's something off, just moderate observational skills. We're simply not in those computer science classrooms. And we're simply not in those tech start-ups. At least not in the numbers we should be.
				<br><br>
				There are many issues that funnel into the greater problem, the most basic probably being we don't encourage our girls to participate in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. At a too-early age, girls are implicitly taught their male counterparts are “supposed to be” good at math and sciences, causing them to look elsewhere for specialization. For the few girls who ride out their passion for STEM, they're met with a multitude of other barriers later in life. They're one of the few female survivors operating in an intimidating boys' club atmosphere. They have to overcome implicit biases that women can't cut it, aren't as smart (or else, why wouldn't there be more of them). Their leaders and mentors in the space don't look like them, don't understand their perspective as a woman - it's much harder to think you can succeed if no one like you has ever done it. In job interviews, these women are more likely to be passed on for "culture fit reasons" (read: aren't entrenched in the bro lifestyle) and offered less money should they make it through. This is all to say that the lack of representation spirals out of control and makes for a ripe breeding ground of inequality.
				<br><br>
				My freshman year of high school was when I first discovered computer science. I took a C++ class and absolutely fell in love. I stuck with it all 4 years, participating in competitions and studying for AP tests. It wasn't until the later years of high school career, when gender differences become more pronounced, that I realized I was the only girl. In fact, there were never that many girls to begin with and the few who I started with dropped off for inexplicable reasons despite being among the smartest. I routinely got the highest grades in my compsci class, causing my (male) peers to wage a (friendly) war against me. Eventually I couldn't help but feel I had the weight of all womankind on my shoulders. I represented us well, but it got exhausting to view everything through the lens of "us" versus "them" because my other-ness was constantly pointed out to me. When I got to college I enrolled in a compsci course. At my school we were able to preview classes before committing to them. I walked into a large room of males and immediately my stomach sank. More of the same. 
				<br><br>
				I decided to major in psychology instead of computer science, thereby altering the course of my life forever. I always looked back with a tinge of regret, wishing my younger self was a little more brave, a little more self-confident, a little more of a fighter. 
				<br><br>
				But the deciding factor here shouldn't be a matter of courage. If only we allowed our little girls to follow the same pursuits as little boys, we wouldn't have this issue. Engineering gadgets wouldn't be in the "boys" section of the toy store. Being good at math wouldn't be seen as an inherently male quality. Teachers would encourage Jane to join woodshop class just as much as home-ec. Girls would see their peers in the (STEM) classrooms and their mothers and aunts as leaders and mentors. Tech companies would excel from diversity of thought and experience, a natural consequence of employing more women.
				<br><br>
				If only.
