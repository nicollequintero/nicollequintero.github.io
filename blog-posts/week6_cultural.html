			<p class="entrytitle"> Ignorance was Bliss </p>

				I grew up in a city whose diversity I couldn't fully appreciate until later in life. As a kid, my best friends were Vietnamese, black, portuguese, white, Puerto Rican and Ecuadorian. I, someone who identifies as Latina, was a member of and eventually president, of the Asian club in high school. All this is to say that I didn't consider that my ethnicity as a defining part of who I was, at least not at the top of the list of all the other things I considered myself: a nerd, a techie, an avid reader, etc. If you would've asked me back then, I would've said my ethnicity played little part in how I maneuvered through life. Though idealistic, I certainly didn't have a realistic view of race and ethnicity or of what being an ethnic minority in America meant. Then I went to collegeâ€¦ and boy was I in for a rude awakening.
				<br><br>
				I took psychology classes from the start and ended up majoring in it, with a concentration in social psychology. For two years I worked as the assistant manager of a research laboratory that focused on threatened identities. Stereotype threat is a subject I studied ad nauseam. But more than that, it really fucked with my head.
				<br><br>
				The thing is, before I learned about stereotype threat, implicit biases and the myriad cognitive biases that govern our social world, I lived a fairly ignorant and carefree life. Of course I realized that I was the only girl in my computer science classes and that my male classmates wanted to dethrone me as the top student. I even realized part of that was simply because I was a girl. And I also noticed the exchange program we had with students in a wealthy, mostly white suburb of Connecticut was a social experiment in bringing the "disadvantaged" and "advantaged" youths together (cue the "West Side Story" overture). But it wasn't until really studying these issues in college that I realized my experience wasn't limited to a few overly competitive boys in high school. It would follow me. Everywhere. 
				<br><br>
				I learned that in all of my math and science classes I'd just be expected to perform less well than boys. I learned that in my reading and writing classes I'd just be expected to be less well read than my white classmates. I learned that I couldn't administer certain tests for my own research laboratory because as a Latina I'd be perceived as an immigrant and bias the state of mind of the test-takers. I learned that at my part-time accounting job I'd be immediately judged as reliable and immature just for being young.
				<br><br>
				Damn, ignorance was bliss.
				<br><br>
				Maybe it was the perfect storm of knowledge, youthful angst and I'm-in-college-so-I-have-to-find-myself-now, but the weight of all that judgment weighed me down. Don't get me wrong, I played out my dutiful Type A role and did just fine in my classes, met a lot of people and excelled in my major. But I definitely held back at times. There's the scholarships I didn't apply for thinking I'd never qualify. There are the discussion groups where I stood silent lest I speak for my entire person-kind and be judged, or worse, cause judgement on said people. There were the extra few heart palpitations before an exam or group presentation.
				<br><br>
				I won't even offer an attempt to solve these issues. We all have our hangups and these are (just some of) mine. But one thing I know for sure is that THIS helps. Talking and listening. I only wish I could've had the freedom and safe space to talk about the things that (even mildly) plagued me back then. I never in my wildest dreams expected we'd be talking about stereotype threat at DBC and it makes me love it so much more for that. If I had to guess, I'd bet the catharsis of taking the anxious energy, balling it up and putting it back out into the ether would've helped back then. I hope we can all learn to respect and listen to our peers and give them that opportunity if nothing else.
